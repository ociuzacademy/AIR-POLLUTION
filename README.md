# Air Pollution Classification web app using Machine Learning and HTML-Flask
### This is a Machine Learning-based Air quality (AQI - Air Quality Index) classification web app developed by training machine learning models with air quality data.
### The dataset has been processed and cleaned to train ML algorithms.
### The Data Analysis and ML algorithm training can be found in the colab notebook - Part1_Data_and_Model_Training.ipynb
### The Model testing can be found in the colab notebook - Part2_Test_The_Model.ipynb


### A docx and PPT of the project are also given in this repo.
### The dataset used can be found in the dataset folder.
### The trained ML models are there in the models folder. 


## How to run the web app?
