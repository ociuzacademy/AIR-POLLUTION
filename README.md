# Air Pollution Classification Webapp using Machine Learning and HTML-Flask
### This is a Machine Learning-based Air quality (AQI - Air Quality Index) classification web app developed by training machine learning models with air quality data.
### The dataset has been processed and cleaned to train ML algorithms.
### The Data Analysis and ML algorithm training can be found in the colab notebook - Part1_Data_and_Model_Training.ipynb
### The Model testing can be found in the colab notebook - Part2_Test_The_Model.ipynb
### Both of them can be opened in the Google Colab IDE.


### A docx and PPT of the project are also given in this repo.
### The dataset used can be found in the dataset folder.
### The trained ML models are there in the models folder. 


## How to run the web app?
* The project has been done in Python 3.8.10
* Python libraries required can be found in the requirements.txt file.
* Install all the libraries needed.
* Then run python app.py to see the webapp in action.
* The web app can also be run in Google Colab by running the app.ipynb notebook in Colab.
* Do not need to install the libraries if running in colab.
